After clicking the "Add" button, return to the toolbar, and you'll see that the item has been added, and your remaining funds have been adjusted to reflect the new expense. The expense record is now updated.

Attempting to add an expense of "859" will result in a notification informing you that you do not have enough funds. (check the notification in the bottom right of the image)
